# 💬 RealTalk AI

> **"Don't carry it alone. Vent freely, zero judgment."**

**RealTalk AI** is a next-generation mental health companion designed for the modern user. Unlike generic chatbots, RealTalk features a dynamic personality engine that switches between a supportive listener and a "Hype Man," with a unique localized mode for Kenyan users.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🇰🇪 1. The "Sheng" Mode
- **Culturally Aware:** Toggle the switch to chat in fluent **Nairobi Sheng**.
- **Authentic Slang:** The AI understands and uses terms like *"Manze"*, *"Form"*, *"Bazu"*, and *"Mavitu"*.
- **No Translation Needed:** It speaks your language, literally.

### 🧠 2. Dynamic Personality Engine
- **The Empathetic Friend:** Uses active listening for stress and anxiety.
- **The "Hype Man":** If you're going through a breakup, it boosts your ego.
- **Context Aware:** It detects your hobbies! Mention **FIFA/EAFC** or **Cars**, and it will use metaphors you actually relate to (e.g., *"You're a TOTY Icon, they are a Bronze card"*).

### 💎 3. "Million Dollar" UI
- **Glassmorphism Design:** Frosted glass aesthetic with deep neon glow effects.
- **Dark Mode Native:** Designed for late-night scrolling.
- **Voice Integration:** Click the 🔊 icon to hear the bot speak (English mode).

### 🛡️ 4. Crisis Safety Layer
- A dedicated safety algorithm runs before every response.
- Instantly detects self-harm or severe crisis keywords and overrides the AI to provide professional resources instead.
